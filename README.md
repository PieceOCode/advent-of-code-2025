# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my attemps for the link:https://adventofcode.com/2025[Advent of Code] calendar.
I have decided to use kotlin this year, to get more practices in the language for my work context.

## Executing the kotlin files

To run each solution you have to install both kotlin and java.
Then run this on the command line:

`kotlinc main.kt -d main.jar`

This creates a `main.jar` file which can than be executed using `java`.

`java -jar main.jar`
